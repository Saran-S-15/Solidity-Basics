1. Tweet Creation: Users can post tweets up to a configurable maximum length (default: 250 characters).
2. Likes Management: Users can like or unlike tweets posted by others.
3. Tweet Retrieval: Retrieve individual tweets or all tweets by a specific user.
4. Admin Controls: The contract owner can update the maximum tweet length.
5. Data Management: Tweets are stored in a mapping, where each userâ€™s address maps to their array of tweets.
6. Events: Events are created and emited once the User creates an account, likes an tweet, unlikes an tweet.
